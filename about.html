    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p>Here's a little about me:</p>
    <p>I've always loved stepping into leadership roles, whether it's coaching young athletes, running my summer camp, or working in team environments. Helping others grow, learn, and succeed is something I'm truly passionate about. I thrive in roles where I can make an impactâ€”whether through mentorship, collaboration, or simply leading by example.</p>
    <p>Beyond my professional endeavors, I have a deep appreciation for travel, nature, and color. Finding beauty in the little moments wherever I go, capturing vibrant landscapes, and exploring unique places have become some of my favorite ways to remember my experiences.</p>
    <p>Sports have been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. The energy, competition, and community that sports create have always drawn me in. Whether on the ice, on the field, or behind the scenes, sports have shaped who I am and continue to fuel my passion for a career in the industry.</p>
